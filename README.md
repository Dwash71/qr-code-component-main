## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

My process first started with reading the readme to see what was required. Next, I set up my html to closely match the design layout. Next I tried to get as close as possible to styling the html to match the design. Lastly, ensuring that the website was mobile responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Although this was a beginner project, CSS still is something to get better on. Basically with regards to responsiveness and media queries. I learned how to structure and position items correctly.

### Continued development

Areas of focus that want to really apply myself is learning or becoming more comfortable with CSS and possible Sass. I believe this is a skill that is very much needed to become a good Web Developer.
